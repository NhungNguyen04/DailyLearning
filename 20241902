WHAT IS GIT?
- It's a system that records changes to our files over time
- We can recally specific versions of those files at any given time
- Many people can easily collaborate on a project and have their own version of project files on their computer

GITHUB
- Online service that hosts our projects
- Share our code with other developers
- Devs can download the projects and work on them
- They can re-upload their edits and merge them with the main codebase

    -> git log --oneline: show commits
2. Revert commit: take you back to the previous commit
    -> git revert <commit code>
    -> press shift+; ->WQ -> enter if we don't want to go back to the previous commit
3. Reset commit: permanently take you back to the previous commit
